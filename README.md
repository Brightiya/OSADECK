# OSADECK — Multi-Deck DJ Audio Application 🎧

OSADECK is a modern desktop DJ and audio playback application built with **C++17** and the **JUCE Framework**.

The application simulates a simplified DJ mixing environment with three independent audio decks, real-time waveform visualization, playlist management, playback manipulation, and audio effects processing.

Developed as a multimedia software engineering project, OSADECK demonstrates practical concepts in:

* real-time audio programming
* GUI application development
* event-driven systems
* modular software architecture
* object-oriented design using modern C++

# Core Components

| Component           | Description                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DJAudioPlayer`     | Handles audio loading, playback, transport control, resampling, gain control, seeking, and audio effects |
| `DeckGUI`           | Provides deck controls, waveform interaction, sliders, and playback UI                                   |
| `WaveFormDisplay`   | Renders waveform thumbnails and playback positions                                                       |
| `PlaylistComponent` | Manages playlist interactions, drag-and-drop loading, and deck queueing                                  |
| `TrackList`         | Stores and organizes track metadata                                                                      |
| `MainComponent`     | Coordinates the application layout, mixer, and audio engine                                              |

# Application Architecture

OSADECK separates responsibilities into modular components:

* Audio processing layer
* Waveform rendering layer
* Graphical user interface layer
* Playlist management system
* Deck interaction system

This modular architecture improves:

* maintainability
* scalability
* readability
* component reusability

---

# How It Works

OSADECK uses JUCE audio components to:

* load audio files
* stream audio in real time
* visualize waveforms
* manipulate playback speed
* control gain and transport position
* apply real-time reverb effects
* manage multi-deck playback

Tracks can be:

* loaded directly into decks
* dragged into the playlist
* queued into specific decks
* searched within the playlist

---

# Prerequisites

Before running the project, install:

* JUCE Framework
* Xcode (macOS)
* Git
* A C++17 compatible compiler

---

# Installation

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Brightiya/OSADECK.git
cd OSADECK
```

---

# JUCE Setup

This project uses the JUCE Projucer workflow rather than CMake.

## Install JUCE

Download JUCE from:

https://juce.com/get-juce/download

---

# Opening the Project

## Open the `.jucer` File

```bash
open OSADECK.jucer
```

Or open it directly using Projucer.

---

# Configure JUCE Modules

Ensure the following JUCE modules are enabled:

* juce_core
* juce_events
* juce_graphics
* juce_gui_basics
* juce_gui_extra
* juce_audio_basics
* juce_audio_formats
* juce_audio_utils
* juce_audio_devices

---

# Export to Xcode

Inside Projucer:

```text
File → Save Project and Open in IDE
```

This automatically generates the Xcode project.

---

# Running the Application

In Xcode:

```text
Press ▶ Run
```

The application launches as a desktop DJ audio player.

---

# Using VS Code

You may also edit the project using VS Code:

```bash
code .
```

However, building and exporting are handled through:

* Projucer
* Xcode

rather than directly through VS Code.

---

# Current Functionality

* audio file loading
* waveform rendering
* playlist management
* drag-and-drop audio importing

* Crossfader implementation
* Equalizer and audio filters
* Audio recording/exporting
* Persistent playlist storage
* Keyboard shortcuts
* Improved UI responsiveness
* Streaming integration
* Beat synchronization
* Cue point support

---

# Learning Outcomes
